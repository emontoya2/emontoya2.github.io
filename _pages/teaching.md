## Fall 2023

* Math 2200:  Introduction to Statistical Concepts and Methods (sections 03 and 04)
    + Course Description: This course is an introduction to statistical methods which stresses the development of critical thinking skills and increased awareness of how these methods are applied in a variety of disciplines. It is designed to give students a foundation for further study of statistics. Topics include: descriptive statistics, sampling and experimentation, confidence intervals, two-sample hypothesis tests for means, topics in categorical data analysis, and simple linear regression. Additional topics may include one way and two-way ANOVA for completely randomized designs. This course will emphasize the statistical reasoning underlying the methods and make use of the mathematical software program R.  
    
* Math 4210: Regression Modeling and Analysis (section 01)
    + Course Description: Advanced course in applied regression analysis. Students develop a sense of the applicability of regression as a tool for analysis of data. Topics include: linear regression, randomization tests for linear regression, correlation analysis, model diagnostics and remedial measures, matrix algebra notation and literacy for developing concepts of linear regression, variable and model selection techniques. Additional topics may include Poisson regression, logistic regression, path analysis, forecasting, and special topics selected by instructor. Statistics software R is used throughout the course.
