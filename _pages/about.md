I am a Professor of Statistics in the  <a href="https://www.csub.edu/math/" target="_blank"> Department of Mathematics </a> at  <a href="linhttps://www.csub.edu" target="_blank"> California State University, Bakersfield </a> (CSUB). Before coming to CSUB, I received my Ph.D. in Statistics and Applied Probability at <a href="https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank"> UC Santa Barbara </a> in 2009. My research interests focus on regression smoothing methods, functional data analysis, computational statistics, data mining techniques, and collaborating with researchers in a variety of fields. I also have a passing interest in the field of statistics education.
