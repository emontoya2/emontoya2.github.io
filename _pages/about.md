I am a Professor of Statistics in the  [Department of Mathematics](https://www.csub.edu/math/) at  [California State University, Bakersfield](https://www.csub.edu) (CSUB). Before coming to CSUB, I received my Ph.D. in Statistics and Applied Probability at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/) in 2009. My research interests focus on regression smoothing methods, functional data analysis, computational statistics, data mining techniques, and collaborating with researchers in a variety of fields. I also have a passing interest in the field of statistics education.
