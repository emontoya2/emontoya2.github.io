## Research Interest

+ Environmental statistics -- development and application of statistical methods to environmental science

+ Functional Data Analysis --  statistical analysis of data samples consisting of random functions or surfaces

+ Data mining methods -- analysis of observational data to find unsuspected relationships

+ Nonparametric regression -- regression analysis in which the model does not take a parametric form but rather a non-parametric form driven by the data.
