## Research Interest

- **Environmental Statistics**: Development and application of statistical methods in the environmental sciences.

- **Functional Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis of data samples consisting of random functions or surfaces.

- **Computational Statistics**: Development and application of computational and graphical approaches to solving statistical problems.

- **Data Mining Methods**: Analysis of observational data to find unsuspected relationships.

- **Nonparametric Regression**: Regression analysis in which the model does not take a parametric form but is driven by the data.

## R Package and Shiny App Development

When time permits, I focus on developing **R packages** and **R Shiny applications** that enhance the accessibility and applicability of statistical methods. Some of my current projects include:

- **[CSUBstats](https://github.com/emontoya2/csubstats)**: An R packaged developed for use with *[Training modules on selected statistical methods](https://emontoya2.github.io/tmsm/)* and future educational resources.

- **[SWEViz](https://emontoya2.shinyapps.io/sweviz/)**: A Shiny app designed for visualizing snowpack (SWE) data across the Sierra Nevada.  

 
## Interested in conducting research?

Are you interested in environmental statistics, data analysis, or building interactive tools like Shiny apps?
If you have a dataset, a research question, or an idea for a data-driven application, feel free to **[contact me](mailto:emontoya2@csub.edu)**. I would be happy to explore potential research collaborations.
