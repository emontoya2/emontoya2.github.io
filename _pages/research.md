## Research Interest

- **Environmental Statistics**: Development and application of statistical methods in the environmental sciences.

- **Functional Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis of data samples consisting of random functions or surfaces.

- **Computational Statistics**: Development and application of computational and graphical approaches to solving statistical problems.

- **Data Mining Methods**: Analysis of observational data to find unsuspected relationships.

- **Nonparametric Regression**: Regression analysis in which the model does not take a parametric form but is driven by the data.

## R Package and Shiny App Development

When time permits, I focus on developing **R packages** and **R Shiny applications** that enhance the accessibility and applicability of statistical methods. Some of my current projects include:

- **tmsm**: An R package for *Training modules on selected statistical methods*

- **SWEViz**: A Shiny app designed for visualizing snowpack (SWE) data across the Sierra Nevada.  

- **SkillTrackGE**: This interactive Shiny app allows one to explore and analyze the completion rates of key GE areas using data from a CSV file. It calculates the overall conditional and unconditional percentage of students who have not completed a selected GE area, providing a quick snapshot of foundational skills completion across your institution.
