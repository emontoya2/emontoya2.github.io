## Minor & Concentration Requirements  

The **Minor in Applied Statistics** requires at least **four courses** chosen from the following:

### **Recommended for most students:**

- **MATH 2200**: Introduction to Statistical Concepts and Methods
- **MATH 3210**: Applied Statistical Computing and Multivariate Methods *(Fall)*
- **MATH 4210**: Regression Modeling and Analysis *(Fall)*
- **MATH 4230**: Applied Statistical Methods for Data Science *(Spring)*  

### **Other options based on interest:**  
- **MATH 3200**: Probability Theory *(Fall, Spring; Calculus-based)*  
- **MATH 4200**: Mathematical Statistics *(Spring; Calculus-based)*
