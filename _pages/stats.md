## Why study statistics?

+ Data drives almost every corner of our world from Economics to Nursing to Psychology and everything in between. Statistics is the science of learning from data in order to make decisions when faced with uncertainty. Whether you are planning to get a job right after graduation or planning to pursue an advanced degree, you will need to understand how to use data to support decision making in the presence of uncertainty. The ability to conduct data visualization, modeling, inferences, and prediction is becoming increasingly important to employers.

+ A concentration or minor in statistics equips you with skills that complement any fields. The concentration or minor focuses on applications of statistics, and it will provide valuable experience in quantitative applications that enhance employment opportunities in a variety of fields as well as preparation for graduate study.

+ Planning to be a math teach?  Offerings of AP stats still continue to increase at a faster rate than AP Calc. For AP Statistics, the exam numbers have climbed since the course was first introduced in 1997. The number of high school students taking the exam has grown from just 7,667 students in 1997 to 219,392 students in 2019. The minor is open to any major, including mathematics majors pursing a teaching concentration.  The minor in stats is also something one can leverage should one decide not to teach.
 

## Minor requirements: 

+ The minor requires at least four courses chosen from MATH 2200, 3200, 3210, 4200, 4210, and 4220. The concentration requires all statistics courses. Students are strongly encouraged to meet with a statistics faculty member as soon as they decide to minor in applied statistics.
